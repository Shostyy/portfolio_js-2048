[DEMO LINK](https://shostyy.github.io/portfolio_js-2048/)

This is a simple implementation of the popular 2048 game using only native JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game follows the same rules as the original: slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048. The game ends when no more moves can be made, or when a tile with the number 2048 is created.

# Features
* Native JavaScript implementation: No frameworks or libraries used.
* Simple user interface: Clean and intuitive interface for an enjoyable gaming experience.
* Score tracking: Keep track of your score as you play.

# How to Play
* Use arrow keys (↑, ↓, ←, →) to move tiles in the respective direction.
* Tiles with the same number merge into one when they collide.
* Keep merging tiles to reach the 2048 tile and beyond.
* The game ends when no more moves can be made.
